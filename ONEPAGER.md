# Spezzatura Lite
### Consistency as a Service (CaaS) for Startup Investment Data

---

## The Problem

The startup investment ecosystem operates under **structural information asymmetry**.

Key data points used in early-stage decisions — especially **cap table structure, corporate history, and disclosed facts** — are:
- self-declared
- fragmented across sources
- rarely cross-validated
- not designed for high-frequency verification

This creates a trust gap where **intuition replaces evidence**.

---

## What Spezzatura Lite Is

**Spezzatura Lite** is a **Consistency-as-a-Service (CaaS)** infrastructure that converts
subjective declarations into **deterministic consistency signals**.

It does **not** claim truth.  
It answers a narrower, safer, and more useful question:

> *“Is what is being declared internally consistent and coherent with authoritative references?”*

---

## What Spezzatura Lite Is NOT

- ❌ Investment advice  
- ❌ Startup rating or ranking  
- ❌ Cap table registry  
- ❌ Compliance or legal opinion  
- ❌ Predictive analytics  

Spezzatura Lite produces **signals**, not decisions.

---

## Core Value Proposition

**Trust by Physics**

Instead of narrative-based trust, Spezzatura Lite enforces:
- deterministic logic
- reproducible processes
- explicit failure modes
- audit-ready outputs

Every result can be **replayed, inspected, and verified**.

## Cap Table Consistency (Primary Use Case)

Cap table data is the **largest unresolved integrity gap** in startup datasets.

Spezzatura Lite does NOT assert ownership truth.

It evaluates:
- internal coherence of declared cap tables
- consistency across funding events
- alignment between disclosures and authoritative records (when available)

The output is a **consistency signal**, not a shareholder registry.

---

## Zero-Persistence Security Model

- Sensitive inputs are processed **ephemerally**
- No raw data is stored or logged
- Only **non-sensitive derived artifacts** may be persisted
- Artifacts are immutable and hash-verifiable

This design aligns with modern privacy and regulatory constraints.

---

## Who Uses It

- Venture Capital firms (intake triage)
- Accelerators and incubators
- Startup data platforms
- Marketplaces requiring integrity signals

Designed for **low-cost, high-frequency screening**.

---

## Ecosystem Alignment

Spezzatura Lite is built to **complement data platforms**, not replace them.

It provides:
- deterministic integrity signals
- especially where authoritative data is missing (e.g. cap tables)

Cloud-native analytics platforms are used as **reference implementations**
for storing **derived, non-sensitive proof-of-check artifacts** only.

---

## Output

Each evaluation produces:
- a deterministic TrustScore (consistency level)
- explicit inconsistency signals
- an immutable proof-of-check artifact
- no recommendations, no opinions

---

## Why It Matters

Spezzatura Lite enables markets to:
- replace intuition with reproducibility
- automate early diligence safely
- scale trust without storing sensitive data

**Trust becomes a verifiable process, not a belief.**
