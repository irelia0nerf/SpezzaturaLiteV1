## What it is
Consistency-as-a-Service (CaaS) for startup investment data.

## What it does
Transforms subjective claims into deterministic consistency signals.

## What it is NOT
- Not investment advice
- Not a registry
- Not compliance software

## Why it exists
Cap table and corporate data lack authoritative consistency checks.

## How it works
Zero-Persistence → Deterministic Core → Versioned Rules → Proof-of-Check.

## Who uses it
Investors, accelerators, data platforms.

## Trust Model
Trust by Physics: reproducible processes, not intuition.
