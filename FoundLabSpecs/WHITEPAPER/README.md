# The Whitepaper
> **"From Fact to Feedback. The Theory of Trust."**

This directory hosts the foundational academic, mathematical, and conceptual papers that define F2F-RAaT.

While the `ATI_ARCHITECTURE` directory describes the *System*, the Whitepaper describes the *Soul*—the deep problem-solving philosophy behind **Reputational Execution**.

## 📜 Core Documents

### 1. [F2F-RAaT Whitepaper v1.1](F2F-RAAT_WHITEPAPER_v1.1.md)
*   **The Problem**: Why probabilistic reputation fails in regulated markets.
*   **The Hypothesis**: Trust can be modeled as physics (Conservation of Reputation).
*   **The Mechanism**: How to construct a closed-loop feedback system.
*   **Regulatory Alignment**: See the **[Compliance Matrix](../COMPLIANCE_KIT/COMPLIANCE_MATRIX.md)** for legal justifications.

### 2. [Glossary of Terms](glossary.md)
A strictly defined lexicon is critical for precision.
*   **Fact**: An atomic, immutable unit of improved behavior.
*   **Capsule**: A PII-free boundary object.
*   **Burn**: The irrevocable execution of a decision.

## 🔬 Key Concepts Introduced

*   **The "Oracle Problem" in Reputation**: Why you can't trust data you didn't measure.
*   **Reputation as Currency**: Why it must be spent to be proven.
*   **The Anti-Fragile Loop**: How successful transactions must mathematically increase future trust limits.
