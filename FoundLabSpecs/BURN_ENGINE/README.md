# Burn Engine Specification

This directory contains the technical specification for the **Burn Engine**.

Within the FoundLab **Auditable Trust Infrastructure (ATI)**, the Burn Engine serves as the **active intervention and enforcement actuator**. It is the component that translates high-confidence risk detections from the Guardian AI into irreversible, programmatic actions in real-time.

Refer to the main [Cognitive Auditability & AI document](../../ATI_ARCHITECTURE/03_COGNITIVE_AUDITABILITY_AI.md) for its strategic role.
