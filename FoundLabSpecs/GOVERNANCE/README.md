# Governance Framework

This directory specifies the governance protocols for the FoundLab ATI.

This includes rules for policy signing, the deterministic handling of `OverrideFacts`, and break-glass procedures. These governance rules are critical for maintaining the integrity and auditability of the entire infrastructure.

The protocols defined here are the implementation details of the high-level governance required by the canonical architecture.
